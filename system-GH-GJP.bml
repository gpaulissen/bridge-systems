#+DESCRIPTION: Based on Dutch doubleton (five card major, strong NT, Multi, Muiderberg)

* Introduction

Let's start with the basic opening structure of the system:

1C  = 2+!c, NAT or BAL, 11+ HCP (12+ if BAL)
1D  = 4+!d, 11+ HCP (12+ if BAL)
1HS = 5+!h/!s, 11+ HCP (12+ if BAL)
1N  = 15--17 BAL
2C  = Weak-two in !d / Any game force except !d
2D  = Multi-coloured: 6+!h/6+!s and 5--10 HCP or 22--24 BAL or FG with !d
2M  = 5M, 4+m, 5-10 HCP
2N  = 20-22 HCP, BAL (5M332 or 5m422 possible) and maybe even 4441, 5431 or 6322 (no 5+M)
3X  = PRE
3N  = Gambling

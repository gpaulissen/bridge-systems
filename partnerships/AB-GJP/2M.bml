* Weak-two opening bids

Both 2!h and 2!s show a weak two bid and less than a one level opening
bid. Non-vulnerable possibly 5M (especially by Albert) and usually 5-10
HCP. Vulnerable the opening promises a good 6 card suit and 9-11 HCP.

A change of suits is non forcing after a non-vulnerable opening but forcing otherwise.

*** 2M-2NT

Classic French, so a bid shows a top honor and a repetition is the weakest bid.

* Slem bidding

** Game forcing fit situations

*** Major at the three level

For example 1!s-2!h-3!h.

When a fit has been agreed upon, one may sign-off in four of the major as a
sign-off. 3NT is not a minimum but not very strong neither ("la premi√®re
zone") and a control bid is stronger ("la seconde zone").

** Blackwood

Actually Roman Key Card Blackwood with old fashioned responses (30-41).

4N
  5C = 0-3 key cards
  5D = 1-4 key cards
  5H = 2-5 key cards, no trump Queen
  5S = 2-5 key cards, trump Queen

*** Asking for the trump Queen

The trump Queen can be demanded after 5!c/5!d with the first free bid. 
The lowest of 5NT and the trump suit without jump denies the Queen. Any other
bid in a suit promises the Queen plus only the King in that suit OR the two
other Kings (the King of trumps is ignored of course).

*** Intervention after 4NT

Double (or redouble) is for penalties. Pass shows an even number : 0/2/4 key
cards. The first free bid shows 1/3/5 key cards.

* 1m-1M-2M

1m-1M
  2M = MIN, usually 4M but sometimes 3M is possible with a singleton or small doubleton
    2N = F1, any INV+
      3C = shortage in lowest unbid suit
      3D = shortage in highest unbid suit
      3M = MIN, 4M
      3N = 4M333
      4M = MAX, 4M
      3oM/4om = MAX, 4M, SPL in the suit bid
      4m = MAX, 5422
    3M = 5M, (mildly) INV
    2S/3H = (bid in other major w/o jump), 54 MM, INV+
    3CD = 5M, NAT, S/T

** Responses

We play new fashioned responses: 5C means 1 or 4 key cards, 5D means 0 or 3.

** Asking for the trump Queen

Back to the trump suit (without jump) denies the Queen. Any other
bid in a suit promises the Queen plus only the King in that suit. 6NT promises the trump Queen and all Kings (never bid 7!).

** Asking for Kings

Any side suit shows the King (up the line), 6 of the agreed trump suit denies. 6 NT shows all Kings (never bid 7!).

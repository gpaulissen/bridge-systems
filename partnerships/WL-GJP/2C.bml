** Second negative and the 2!c opening

Changes 2018-01-09:

- Added second negative after first relay by responder after 2!c-2!d-2M

After 2!c-2!d-2!h-2!s or 2!c-2!d-2!s-2NT and a rebid by opener just up to 3!h,
responder shows a second negative with the next step (thus the second negative
is never 3NT). It shows a really negative hand (0-4 HCP). The rest is natural
and thus 5+ HCP.

2C-2D-2S-2N-3H
  3S = second negative
  4C = S/T !h
  4D = S/T !s

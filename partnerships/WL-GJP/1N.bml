Shows 15-17 HCP (semi)Balanced, 5m422 or 6m are possible and rarely singleton K or Q. 14 or 17 with a 5crd suit are upgraded regularly.

- 1NT-2!d-2!h-2NT and 1NT-2!-2!s-2NT FG with 5431
- 1NT-2!d-2!h-3m FG with 55 or S/T

After 1NT-2!h we use the same structure as over 1NT-2!d, so very natural.

1N-2N
  3C = Forced
    3D = 5-5 !d+!c FG
    3M = SPL 6+!c
    3N = suggests SPL !d
        
1N-3C
  3D = Forced
    3M = SPL 
    3N = suggest SPL !c

*** Continuation after 1NT-2!s

1N-2S
  2N = Forced
    3X = Shortness, bidding continues natural

** They bid over our 1NT opening

After a double we play system on. The only new bid is redouble which depends
on the meaning of double. If double is for penalties (or just showing values),
the redouble is a Puppet to 2!c. In any other case the redouble shows values
as well and is forcing till 2!s.

1N-(2C)
  D = values and a double later on is for take out
  2D = NF
  2H = NF (?)
  2S = minors (?)
  2N = transfer lebensohl
  3X = transfer lebensohl

*** They bid over stayman

1N-(P)-2C-(D)
  P = no !c stopper
    R = Stayman again, INV+
      2D = 4+!h
      2H = 4+!s
      2S = no 4+M
      2N = MM, MIN
      3C = MM, MAX
  R = Proposal to play (4)5+!c
  2DHS = !c stopper, system on
  2N = !c stopper, system on
  3C = !c stopper, system on

1N-(P)-2C-(2D)
  P  = no M
  D  = 4+!h
  2H = 4+!s
  2N = MM, MIN
  3C = MM, MAX

1N-(P)-2C-(2M)
  D  = take out (4+oM)
  2S = 5+!s

1N-(P)-2C-(3m)
  D  = at least one major
  3M = 5+M

*** They bid over our transfer

1N-(P)-2red-(D)
  P = no 3 cards fit 
    R = retransfer
    1step = to play
    3m = 5-5, NF
  R = 3+ cards fit, wants partner to play (usually no stopper or something like Ax(x))
  2M = 3+ cards fit, wants to play (usually a stopper)

When they bid over our transfer a double is just for penalties.  Support shows
a good hand with fit, after 2D at least 4 cards (partner may have 4!h5!s in
the majors). If they bid our cuebid dbl shows fit and willingness to compete.

* The 1 major opening

One of a major promises 5 cards and at least 11 HCP. It is limited since with
game forcing hands you open 2!c.

After a non fit response of 1!s or 1NT a direct 2NT rebid promises 6 cards in
the major and maybe 4 cards in a minor. The 2NT bid is then forcing to game.
An indirect 2NT rebid (via Gazilli) promises 18-19 NT or 17-19HCP with 5M4m.

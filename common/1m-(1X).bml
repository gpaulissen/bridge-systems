* Transfers after 1m and a one level overcall

Changes 2018-01-10:

- totally rewritten

Changes 2018-01-16:

- Added bids at the three level.

All bids up to 2!s (excluding 1NT and 2!c after a 1!d opening) are
transfers. All bids are FG opposite a strong opener (17+ HCP).

When X is their suit bid and Y is a new suit bid there are seven variants:

1. 2Y (m =< Y < X-1) shows a transfer to the next suit showing at least 5 cards. An example is 1!d-(1!s)-2!d.
2. 2Y (Y = X-1) is a transfer to their suit hence it shows fit and it is at least INV. An example is 1!d-(1!s)-2!h.
3. 2Y (X <= Y < !s) is a transfer to the next suit showing at least 6 cards,
   either weak (6-9 HCP) or FG. An example is 1!d-(1!h)-2!h.
4. 3m is natural (at least 5 cards after 1!c and 4 otherwise) and weak.
5. 3Y (Y < X) shows at least 6 cards and is weak.
6. 3Y (X <= Y < !s) is a transfer to the next suit showing at least 6 cards
   and is invitational.
7. 3S is a transfer to 3NT showing at least Axx in their suit.

It is more difficult to play 2m but not impossible. You may be able to bid
1!s, a transfer to 1NT, after which you can correct to 2m.

1m-(1X)
  D  = Negative double with at least 4 (and at most 5) cards in the next suit (X<!s) or the other major (X=!s).
  1H = Transfer to 1!s. At least 4!s.
  1S = Transfer to 1NT. Normally a hand without a good stopper.
  1N = NAT
  2m = A transfer to the next suit showing at least 5 cards.
  2S = A transfer to 2NT. At least INV. Opener should play (positional).
  2N = Natural, INV
  3S = FG, BAL, Axx in their suit and wants to play 3NT

1D-(1X)
  2C = NAT and INV+

1C-(1D)
  2C = variant 2: transfer to their suit, hence fit and at least INV
  2DH = variant 3: transfer to the next suit, showing at least 6 cards
  3C = barrage
  3D = variant 4: 6!h, INV
  3H = variant 4: 6!s, INV

1C-(1M)
  2C = variant 1: transfer to the next suit (!d) showing at least a reasonable 5 card suit and 9+HCP (trying for 3NT)
  3CD = barrage

1m-(1H)
  2D = variant 2: transfer to their suit, hence fit and at least INV
  2H = variant 3: transfer to the next suit (!s), showing at least 6 cards
  3H = variant 4: 6!s, INV

1m-(1S)
  2D = variant 1: transfer to the next suit, showing a reasonable 5 card suit and 9+HCP or 6 cards and 6+HCP
  2H = variant 2: transfer to their suit, hence fit and at least INV
  3H = 6!h, INV

** Further development

Opener responds to a 1 level transfer as if the bid has been bid naturally but
accepting the transfer shows 3 cards. Accepting the transfer by jumping to the two level
just shows a minimal opening and 4 cards. When responder shows (not
necessarily bids) !h or !s after 1!c a 2!d bid is system-on.

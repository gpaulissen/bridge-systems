- 2NT-3!c-3!s-4!h shows !s fit (typo solved)

After 2NT we try to reach 5-3 major fits even with 5!s-4!h. This means that
standard Puppet Stayman is not good enough. So after the 3!c response, opener
must evaluate his hand opposite 5!s-4!h.

2N
  3C = (R)
    3D = one of:
         1) 4!s, maybe 4!h
         2) no 4M, suitable for 4!s opposite 5!s-4!h
      3H = 4!s
        3S = variant 1
        3N = variant 2
      3S = 4!h, maybe a S/T with 5!s-4!h
        3N = no 4!h
      4m = NAT, S/T, see 1NT-2C-2D-4C
      4H = 5!s-4!h, TRF to 4!s
    3H = 4+!h, no 4!s
      3S = (R)
        3N = exact 4!h
      4m = 5m
    3S = 5!s
      4m = 5m
      4H = S/T for !s
    3N = no 4M, no interest in playing 4!s opposite 5!s-4!h
  3D = 5+!h, TRF
    3H = NF
      3S = 5!h-4!s, FG
        4C = S/A for !h
        4D = S/A for !s
      4C = 5!h-4!c
        4D = K/B (only great fit for !c possible)
        4H = NAT
      4D = 5!h-4!d
        4H = NAT
        4S = K/B (only great fit for !d possible)
      4H = S/T
    3S = good fit, second suit
    3N = 5!s2!h33
      4C = S/A for !s
      4D/4H = TRF
    4m = good fit, second suit
  3H = 5+!s, TRF
    3S = NF
      4C = 5!s-4!c
        4D = K/B (only great fit for !c possible)
        4S = NAT
      4D = 5!s-4!d
        4H = K/B (only great fit for !d possible)
        4S = NAT
      4S = S/T
    3N = 5!h2!s33
      4C = S/A for !h
      4D/4H = TRF
    4m = good fit, second suit
    4H = good fit, second suit
  3S = mm
    4m = S/A
  4C = 6!h, TRF to 4!h
    4H = forced
  4D = 6!s, TRF to 4!s
    4S = forced
  4H = 6!c, S/T
    4S = fit, MAX
      4N = K/B
    4N = no fit, T/P
      5C = T/P
      5N = K/B
    5C = fit, MIN
      5N = K/B
  4S = 6!d, S/T
    4N = no fit, T/P
      5D = T/P
      5N = K/B
    5C = fit, MAX
      5N = K/B
    5D = fit, MIN
      5N = K/B

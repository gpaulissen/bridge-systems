We play two-suited overcalls after an opponents 1 level opening. The style
depends a lot on vulnerability. A two-suited overcall always shows at least 5+
in both suits.

*** Direct two-suited bids

(1C)-
2C = NAT
2D = MM
2N = !d+!h
3C = Weak, 6+!c

(1D)-
2D = MM
2N = !c+!h
3D = Asks stop for 3NT

(1H)-
2H = !s+m
2N = !c+!d
3H = Asks stop for 3NT

(1S)-
2S = !h+m
2N = !c+m
3S = Ask stop for 3NT

*** They bid after our two-suited overcall

If they bid a new suit intended as natural, dbl is penalty.  If they support
each other, dbl is for take-out and may be INV for the major if you don't have
another invitational bid.  If they bid one of our suits, dbl means that you would have
liked to bid that.

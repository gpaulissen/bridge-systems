* The 1!c opening

This is the cornerstone of the 1 level opening bids: the rest of the 1 level
opening bids depend on the meaning of 1!c. This system has been developed
around 1990 when a club of Dutch bridge players did not want to continue with
the old fashioned 4 card major opening bids.

So 1!h and 1!s show 5 cards and 1!d shows 4 cards. Combined with
the knowledge of the Polish club, 1!c shows a limited opening but is forcing
anyway in order not to end in 1!c when opener is strong with 18-19 HCP and a
balanced hand.

The range of the 1!c opening is between 11 HCP and 22 HCP, so up to (but
excluding) game forcing hands. Because 1!c is forcing you can have quite a
good hand compared with a non forcing 1!c.

Responder has two negative bids: 1!d and 2!d (a kind of Multi) and that means
limited to about 6/7 HCP. When you bid positive the bidding becomes game
forcing opposite a strong hand (17+ HCP). So a possible club fit is important
when you are minimum for a positive bid.

**** Strong with 4 cards fit after 1!c-1M

After 1!c-1M there is room to show an unbalanced and game forcing hand with 4
cards fit by bidding 3!d. After a 1!d opening this is not possible hence the
development after 1!d-1M is different.

  2DHS = NAT, reverse, F
    2N = PUP (maybe S/O in !c)
    3C = FG
  2N = INV, short in the other minor

*** 1!c-2!d

A weak Multi-coloured (<= 6 HCP). A hand that may not be strong enough opposite
a strong (balanced) hand.

1C-2D-
2M = see the 2M opening
2N = idem
3M = idem
3C = NF

*** 1!c-2!h

    Shows at least 5!s-4!h and 5-9 HCP. This bid exists because after 1!c-1!s-2!c a
bid of 2!h is at least INV. It is not mandatory because if you prefer 2!c if
partner rebids it, you can bid 1!d or 1!s.

1C-2H-2N-
3C = MIN, no 5-5
3D = MIN, 5-5
3H = MAX, FG, no 5-5
3S = MAX, FG, 5-5

*** 1!c-2!s

Inverted minor and just INV.

  3C = S/O
  3D = SPL, FG
  3M = idem

*** 1!c-2NT

1C-2N
  3C = S/O
  3D = SPL, FG
  3M = idem

*** Intervention after 1!c

**** 1!c-(D)

Pass is allowed now. All bids except pass, redouble and 1!d remain
unchanged. So for example, 2!c is still inverted minor and FG.

1C-(D)-
P = nothing to bid, maybe even 5-5-3-0
R = at least 10 HCP and not very unbalanced
1D = 5+!d, 0+HCP, opener rebids like after 1!c-1!d without further intervention

**** 1!c-(1X)

We play transfers now.

**** 1!c-(1X)-P-(2X)

Any bid by opener is strong. 2NT is natural after which partner acts as if 2NT has been opened.

**** 1!c-(2X)-P

Like 1!c-(1X)-P-(2X) except that a double may not be so strong.

**** 1!c-(P)-1!d-(D)

A pass shows a minimal balanced hand. Redouble shows a strong hand and at
least 3!d. Other bids are as usual but 1M suggests an unbalanced hand.

**** 1!c-(P)-1!d-(nX)

Double is for take-out and strong and a NT bid shows a maximal balanced hand.

**** 1!c-(P)-1M-(...)

(Re)double shows 3M support but only when we can return to 2M.

**** 1!c-(P)-2!c-(...)

A double is for penalties by opener as long as they do not jump. If they jump
it is for take-out (avoid doubles when short).

**** 1!c-(P)-2!d-(...)

See the Multi-coloured opening.

* Defense against two-suiters

The cheapest bid in of their suits shows the fourth suit and is forcing to
game. Thus not the lowest in the sense of clubs, diamonds but the most
economical bid. The most expensive bid in one of their suits shows fit and is
at least invitational. The reason for this scheme is that you need more space
if you do not have a fit. A 2NT bid shows fit with at least 4 cards and is at
least invitational.
